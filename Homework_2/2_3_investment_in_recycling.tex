\subsection{Investment in recycling}

    \subsubsection{Determine each country’s best-response function.}


    \subsubsection{Indicate the pure strategy Nash Equilibrium ($r1^*,r^*$) on the graph;}

    \subsubsection{On your previous figure, show how the equilibrium would change if the intercept of one of the countries’ average benefit functions bi fell from 10 to some smaller number. What would this mean for the recycling efforts of both countries?}
