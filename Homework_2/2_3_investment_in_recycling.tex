    \subsubsection{Determine each country's best-response function.}
    Since the utilities are defined equally for any country $i$ we can write one best response function for country $i$:
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            BR_i=(r_j)&=max(b_i(r_i,r_j)r_i-4r_i)\\
            &\Leftrightarrow \cfrac{\partial}{\partial r_i}u_i(r_i,r_j)=0\\
            &\Leftrightarrow \cfrac{\partial}{\partial r_i}((10-r_i+\cfrac{r_j}{2})r_i-4r_i)=0\\
            &\Leftrightarrow \cfrac{\partial}{\partial r_i}10r_i-r^2+\cfrac{r_ir_j}{2}-4r_i=0\\
            &\Leftrightarrow r_i = 3+\cfrac{r_j}{4}
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}

                \addplot+[mark=] {3+(x/4)-(1/2)};
                \node[red,scale=6] at (axis cs:4,4) {.};
                \draw[red, dashed] (axis cs:4,4) -- (axis cs:4,0);
                \node[above left, red] at (axis cs:4,0) {$BR_1(r_2)=BR_2(r_1)=4$};
            \end{axis}
            \node [anchor=north] at (0,0) {$0$};

        \caption{Nash-Equilibrium for country one and two. The Nash-Equilibrium is at $r_i=r_j=4$. Additionally, the line where no
        intersection is indicated is the line with different intersect from the next task}
    \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{On your previous figure, show how the equilibrium would change if the intercept of one of the countries' average benefit functions $b_i$ fell from 10 to some smaller number. What would this mean for the recycling efforts of both countries?}
    When calculating the $BR_i$ again, but with $10-c$ instead of 10 in the benefit function, the result is
    $BR_i(r_j)=3+\cfrac{r_j}{4}-\cfrac{c}{2}$. Therefore, the graph would be shifted by half of the applied reduced intercept $c$.
    This would actually decrease the utility of the other country by $\frac{c}{2}$, while the utility at the NE of the county would be
    increased by factor $\cfrac{c}{4}$.
