\subsubsection{Consider the special case where there are only two players (i.e. n = 2). Determine the individual shares x1 and x2 in the Nash equilibrium for this game.}

\subsubsection{Does this Nash equilibrium optimise social welfare which is the aggregated utility of all players (i.e. u1(x) + u2(x)?}

\subsubsection{Can you generalise this result to arbitrary n?}
