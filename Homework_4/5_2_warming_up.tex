We estimated the mean value of $E(cos^2(X))$ by using the Monte Carlo sample-based computation method.\\
We generated one million samples of $X$ and calculated the mean value of $cos^2(X)$ by averaging over the samples.
The result is $\textbf{0.606569}$.\\
The standard deviation of the samples is $0.446786$.\\
The 95\% confidence intervals are
$\textbf{[0.605693;0.607444]}$.\\
(All results were rounded to 6 decimal places.)
