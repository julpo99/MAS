\subsection{Boss and stealing employee}
\subsubsection{Analyse this game using backward induction.}
\subsubsection{What are the pure actions for the two players (boss and employee)? Construct the normal form matrix.}
\subsubsection{Use this matrix to identify all the pure Nash equilibria of the normal form game.}
\subsubsection{Determine the subgame-perfect equilibrium (equilibria?) by eliminating all the Nash equi- libria that fail to induce a NE in subgames.}
\subsubsection{Compare to the solution based on backward induction.}
