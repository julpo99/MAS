The backwards induction shows, that the rational move for the Boss would be to give a warning
and then for the employee to quit steeling.

\subsubsection{What are the pure actions for the two players (boss and employee)? Construct the normal
form matrix.}

\subsubsection{Use this matrix to identify all the pure Nash equilibria of the normal form game.}

\subsubsection{Determine the subgame-perfect equilibrium (equilibria?) by eliminating all the Nash equi-
libria that fail to induce a NE in subgame}

\subsubsection{Compare to the solution based on backward induction.}
