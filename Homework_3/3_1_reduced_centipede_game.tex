\subsection{Reduced centipede game}
\paragraph{Answers}

\subsubsection{Use backward induction to predict the (rational) outcome of this game. Does it make sense to you?}

\subsubsection{2. Write the normal form for this game and find all Nash equilibria in pure strategies (PNEs).}

\subsubsection{3. List all subgames and determine which of these PNEs are also subgame-perfect?}
