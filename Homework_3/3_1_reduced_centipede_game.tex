\subsubsection{Use backward induction to predict the (rational) outcome of this game. Does it make sense to you?}


\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node[circle, black,draw, label={[red]right: 1, 0}] {1}
            child {node[draw] {1, 0} edge from parent [left, blue] node {S}}
            child {node[circle, black, draw, label={right: 0, 2}] {2}
            child {node [draw, black] {0, 2}
            edge from parent [left, blue] node {S}}
            child {node [circle, black,draw, label={right: 3, 1}]{1}
            child {node [draw, black] {3, 1}
            edge from parent [left, blue] node {S}}
            child {node [circle, black,draw, label={right: 2, 4}] {2}
            child {node [draw, black] {2, 4}
            edge from parent [left, blue] node {S}}
            child {node [draw, black] {5, 3}
            edge from parent [right, blue] node {C}}
            edge from parent [right, blue] node {C}}
            edge from parent [right, blue] node {C}} 
            edge from parent [blue] node [right, blue] {C}};

The rational outcome of this game is 1, 0. Given that the utility of both players increases along
the game tree, both players could get better pay-offs. If both players would be altruistic instead
of maximizing their own outcome, they would both go down the tree and would both receive better 
pay-offs.

\subsubsection{Write the normal form for this game and find all Nash equilibria in pure strategies (PNEs).}


\begin{table}[h!]

  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
           &   SS  &  SC   &   CS  &   CC \\ \hline
       SS  & \textbf{1, 0} & \textbf{1, 0} & 1, 0 & 1, 0 \\ \hline
       SC  & \textbf{1, 0} & \textbf{1, 0} & 1, 0 & 1, 0 \\ \hline
       CS  & 0, 2 & 0, 2 & 3, 1 & 3, 1 \\ \hline
       CC  & 0, 2 & 0, 2 & 2, 4 & 5, 3 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}

\subsubsection{List all subgames and determine which of these PNEs are also subgame-perfect?}
