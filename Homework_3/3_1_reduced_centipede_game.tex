\subsection{Reduced Centipede Game}
\subsubsection{Use backward induction to predict the (rational) outcome of this game. Does it make sense to you?}
\subsubsection{Write the normal form for this game and find all Nash equilibria in pure strategies (PNEs).}
\subsubsection{List all subgames and determine which of these PNEs are also subgame-perfect?}
