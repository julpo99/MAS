\subsubsection{Use backward induction to predict the (rational) outcome of this game. Does it make sense to you?}

            edge from parent [right, blue] node {C}}
            edge from parent [right, blue] node {C}}

The rational outcome of this game is 1, 0. Given that the utility of both players increases along
the game tree, both players could get better pay-offs. If both players would be altruistic instead
of maximizing their own outcome, they would both go down the tree and would both receive better 
pay-offs.

\subsubsection{Write the normal form for this game and find all Nash equilibria in pure strategies (PNEs).}

\subsubsection{List all subgames and determine which of these PNEs are also subgame-perfect?}
